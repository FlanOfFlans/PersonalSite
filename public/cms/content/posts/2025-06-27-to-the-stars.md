I've let this sit for a little longer than I hoped, but it's been a busy few months! For one, I recently released a game!

_To The Stars_ was created as part of the [2025 ACH Game Jam](https://itch.io/b/2994/ach-game-jam-2025); it's a fairly simple game, being heavily based on the cult-classic _Yume Nikki._ It's a walking simulator, I guess, just something to wander through and explore. As is the fate of most game jam games, we had to compromise quite a lot to make it to the deadline--quite a lot of our team had to drop out or couldn't contribute to the degree they expected, so the rest of us had to spin a lot more plates than we planned to!

Still, I'm very happy with what we managed to get together. For my part, I primarily built the gameplay systems which do exist, as well as composing the soundtrack. I even did the walk animations, since I was the only one who'd used Godot's animation systems before!

The soundtrack is pretty solid, considering this was my first real foray into serious video game music-writing. It's smaller than I hoped, just 4 tracks shared between the game locations; but each one is something I'm happy with. The process was a blast, too, even if I couldn't devote as much attention to it as I would've liked. Since the project's close, I've actually been really itching to do more. Maybe I'll start poking at some new game jams to keep me in practice. Or, who knows--if you're reading this and need a games composer, maybe send me an email!

To The Stars is [available on itch.io](https://cloudee-enbee.itch.io/to-the-stars) now, for free.

It's also included in the [ACH Game Jam bundle](https://itch.io/b/2994/ach-game-jam-2025) on a pay-what-you-want basis; all proceeds received prior to June 30th, 2025, will be donated to charity.

If you have any thoughts or opinions on the game, please feel free to reach out! I love receiving feedback!
